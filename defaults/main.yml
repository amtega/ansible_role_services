# List of dicts with services to configure. The dicts have the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible service module. For example:
#
# services_list:
#   - name: sshd
#     state: started
#     enabled: systems

# the `services` variable. The members of the dict are the same attributes
# that the ones expected by the ansible service module

# Indicate `services` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host variable
# that begins with "services_list_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `services`
